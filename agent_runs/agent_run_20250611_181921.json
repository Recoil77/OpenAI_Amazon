Since there were 5 hits (not zero) for these variants, particularly for Juará (and possibly for Thomar, as that is the later name for Bararoá), pursuing an entity_hybrid on 'Juará' is logical. This could clarify if Juará (or its mapped variants) is a distinct river or location directly associated with Bararoá/Thomar, providing needed precision. If this fails, the next logical action would be to try 'Thomar' in an entity_hybrid search or, if all local internal clues are exhausted, to move to regional contextualization using distance calculations or external sources. So far, my best clues remain: Bararoá/Thomar was located on the right bank of the Rio Negro, 2021 leagues above the mouth of the Jamundá River, near the Xjuará (likely Juará) River and Timoni Island. My next goal is to see if Juará is confirmed in internal documents as a tributary or geographical feature linked to Bararoá/Thomar, and to record any additional associated clues for more precise mapping. Spelling variant attempts so far are noted: Xjuará, Juará, Xuará, Timoni, Thomar.
