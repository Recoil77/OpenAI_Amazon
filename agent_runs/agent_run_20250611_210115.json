Governor D. Francisco de Souza Coutinho of Pará, seeking to hinder the progress of the Captaincy of Rio Negro under Governor Manoel da Gama Lobo da Almada, secured the dissolution of the Directory by royal decree, leading to the dispersal and decline of Indigenous settlements. There was a belief that merging the Directory with the Missions—combining the roles of Missionary and Director—would have yielded better results. José Bonifacio, in 1823, advocated for this fusion in his notes on the civilization of Indigenous peoples in Brazil.
