In 1840, individuals in Manaus acquired all vacant municipal lands, leading to irregular urban development and the emergence of a new Alfama on the Rio Negro. News of the July 23, 1840 revolution of the Majority of His Majesty Dom Pedro II in Rio de Janeiro reached the district in October 1840. In February 1841, Chamburg arrived in Pirarára from Stabroek, confronting missionary Innocentes over British claims, leading to a temporary withdrawal agreement and a call for official demarcation. The garrison at Fort São Joaquim on the Rio Branco was increased from 30 to 50 bayonets, with defensive measures extending to Boraroá.

King João IV and his successors rejected the appointment of village administrators, paralleling similar abolitions in Castile. Permanent boards or councils were established in the Captaincies, composed of the diocesan prelate, the governor or general, a minister or magistrate (serving as superintendent of Indians), an external judge, the provisor or vicar general, and three senior representatives of religious orders. These boards held broad jurisdiction over both spiritual and temporal matters concerning the Indians, with parish priests required to report to their superiors, ensuring the board remained informed for decision-making.

The next logical step is to investigate its administrative and governance structure, which may provide insight into its political significance, leadership, and the process of its elevation to town status (Thomar) and subsequent demotion. This could also clarify its relationship with regional authorities and the broader colonial system. If this search yields limited new evidence, I will pivot to searching for notable individuals or military events directly tied to Bararoá, as these may offer additional context or unique facts.",
