  "agent_thoughts": "Having established that Bararoá (Thomar) was on the right bank of the Rio Negro, near the Padauari River, and over 200 leagues above the mouth of the Jamundá River, my most promising strategy is to tighten spatial triangulation through its relationship to other known settlements, particularly Santa Izabel. The repeated mention of São José de Iama-IiOaiga being 'between Bararoá and Santa Izabel' suggests that, if I can identify Santa Izabel’s precise placement along the Rio Negro (especially with reference to riverbanks, adjacent streams, or league/distance markers), I may be able to pin down the likely stretch for Bararoá. Since there are multiple 'Santa Isabel/Izabel' settlements in Brazilian Amazonia, but my focus here is strictly the one on the Rio Negro, targeting 'Santa Izabel right bank Rio Negro' in a vector search may yield a historical travel or geographic description that includes concrete positional data. This would likely manifest as either a sequence of settlements upriver, or distance-from-mouth numbers, or key adjacent river/tribal features. Once I have that, I can integrate its positional clues with the previously gathered data on Bararoá’s relative position to the Padauari River and Jamundá, and further solidify or possibly even approximate coordinates or modern correlates. If the search yields no meaningful new data I will try variant spellings or neighboring river names. Notably, previous attempts did not focus precisely on the bank or detailed river position for Santa Izabel.",
