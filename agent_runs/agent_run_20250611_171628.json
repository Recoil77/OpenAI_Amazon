Natives maintained houses in settlements mainly for religious duties and festivals but lived primarily in remote areas, especially as the lack of ministers and weakened authority diminished the settlements' importance.

      "value": "The Tacutú River is an affluent of the Essequibo, rising in the Pacaraima mountains and receiving the Pirarára on its left bank. The Majapi River, inhabited by the Arinas, lies on the left bank of the Uraricoéra between Parimá and Caiacaia in Guiana. The Manaca-purá Lake, on the left bank of the Solimões below Codajaz and 18 leagues above the Rio Negro confluence, is notable for turtle butter and Pirarucu fishing and has emerging rural settlements. The llaiiãois were a dominant Indigenous nation on the Rio Negro and its tributaries, between the Uarirá and Xiuará, and gave their name to the capital city of Upper Amazon; they practiced anthropophagy and held Manichaean beliefs. The city of Afaiiáoii (Our Lady of the Conception of), former capital of the Province of Rio Negro, is located at 3° 03' S, 25° 17' W from Olinda, three leagues above the Rio Negro confluence and 81 from the mouth of the Jamundá, and is divided into the neighborhoods of São Vicente, Matriz, and Remédios.",

  "agent_thoughts": "The entity_hybrid on Bararoá yielded several concrete geographical clues: it was located on the right bank of the Rio Negro, 21 leagues above the Jamundá River (likely a colonial variant for a river in the lower Rio Negro), and near the Padauari River. It was also referenced as a parish that later became the town of Thomar (renamed in 1758, indicating a historical settlement transition). These clues suggest a specific section on the Rio Negro, above the confluence with the Jamundá, and just downstream from the mouth of the Padauari. I have already extracted several candidate clues, but to get further context and perhaps additional supporting details—such as how distances were measured, neighboring settlements, or historical travel descriptions—I'm launching a vector_search with the phrase 'right bank of the Rio Negro', which matches the most concrete physical clue. If this yields unique corroboration or indirect location evidence, I’ll extract it. Otherwise, next steps may involve vector_search with other spatial or historical clues such as 'Padauari River' or the distance above Jamundá. My reasoning is that focusing on the specific riverbank should surface more precise locational narratives or map references from internal sources.",
