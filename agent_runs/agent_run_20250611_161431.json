Settlements such as Bararoá declined drastically, from 780 households to 13, though the population did not decrease proportionally due to widespread dispersion along rivers, lakes, and streams. The fertile banks of these waterways attracted inhabitants to live outside formal settlements, relying on hunting, fishing, and wild fruits for subsistence. Many natives maintained houses in settlements only for religious duties, festivals, or required services, but the lack of ministers and weakened authority led to further abandonment and ruin of settlements. Population counts based on settlements became unreliable as people moved to remote areas, making registration difficult.",

It was founded by Principal Dari, who named it after himself when he separated from Bararoá, and incorporated the Auacihidá Village, located three leagues further upstream. In 1757, a rebellion led to the destruction by fire of São José de Iama-IiOaiga, Bararoá, and Caboquéna, triggered by an Indigenous man’s resentment over a missionary’s interference. The inhabitants, from the Manáos, Banibas, and Barés tribes, cultivated manioc, fruits, rice, coffee, and cotton, and produced cloth, hammocks, ropes, pitch, salsaparrilha, and puxiri. The settlement belonged to the district of Mariuá, and the Tupica language served as the universal language among Indigenous peoples throughout the Province of Pará and much of Brazil.",

The stronghold at Icuipiranga was dismantled by Father Antonio Manoel Sanches de Brito before the expedition’s arrival, forcing rebels to retreat to the headwaters of the Maués River, which allowed communication with both Tapajoz and the Amazon. The town of Lusea was fortified to prevent rebel movements from the Amazon, while forces from Tapajoz maintained pressure. On January 30, 1839, a campaign to Maranhão Grande, led by the 4th Navy Lieutenant, further weakened the rebels. The leader Bararoá, twice confirmed by the Government of Pará, became oppressive, leading to failed uprisings and forcing prominent families into hiding.

  "agent_thoughts": "The accumulated evidence situates Bararoá as a strategically important former mission on the right bank of the Rio Negro, near the Padauari River. It was transformed into the town of Thomar around 1758 following a violent destruction during the 1757 indigenous rebellion that also saw the burning of other major settlements (notably São José de Iama-IiOaiga and Caboquéna). Bararoá was significant as a trading post and agricultural center, with residents from several indigenous nations and an economy based on crops and artisanal products. One gap is the deep context of the rebellion—its origins, who led it, and the fate of residents. I have already established that 'Bararoá' is the most productive spelling, with minor variants returning little unique. To progress, I'll use entity_hybrid under 'Bararoá' to surface in-depth historical records or missionary descriptions not accessible via snippets or prior searches. I am particularly looking for narrative or administrative details tying together the context, destruction events, aftermath, and transformation into Thomar. If this doesn't yield new depth, the next logical step is a web_search targeting Brazilian and missionary archives. I will carry forward all prior direct evidence and negative attempts to maximize aggregation and avoid redundant queries. I remain focused on Bararoá as the sole candidate object, per instructions.",
