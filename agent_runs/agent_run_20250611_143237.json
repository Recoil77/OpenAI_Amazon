The Bares nation lived on the Japurá River, and their descendants, along with those of the Manaos, formed part of Bararoá's population. The settlement experienced significant depopulation and dispersal, with households dropping from 780 to 13, though many inhabitants lived outside the mission, returning only for religious duties and festivals. The Pará revolution of 1835 saw Bararoá as a site of military organization and conflict. The settlement's decline was marked by dispersal rather than absolute population loss, with many Indigenous people avoiding official registration and service.",

King ordered three main regulations: no offensive war or harm against Gentile Indians without royal order; Christian and vassal Indians in villages to live freely under their chiefs and parish priests, only serving as law required; and missionaries to conduct interior missions independently, with governors providing support and allowing the superior of missionaries to select suitable military leaders. Governor André Vidal of Maranhão implemented these orders, enabling missions into the interior. That year, Fathers Francisco Velloso and Thomé Ribeiro led a mission to the Tupinambás, traveling over three hundred leagues up the Tocantins River, making peace with the Guarajús and Catingus before reaching the Tupinambás.",

The Piety missionaries were reputed in the city for only providing Indians when it served their interests and did not send canoes to the interior. Missions under missionary friars were few and had so few Indians that they were of little benefit to either the State or the missionaries. The Jesuit Fathers, though unpopular, maintained temporal governance of villages, and there were calls for stricter oversight of the generals’ authority in distributing Indians.",

The Jesuit Fathers provided large numbers of Indians for royal service, notably in the Solimões and Manãos troops, under the command of João Paes do Amaral. Trade posts in the interior were typically staffed by Jesuits and their Indian converts. Official procedures required notices to be posted at the main church in Belém do Grão-Pará and for Indians in service to be present in the city for wage distribution.

It was destroyed in the 1757 rebellion, refounded as Thomar, and played a role in regional conflicts. Previous searches have clarified its demographic and economic context, as well as its decline and dispersal patterns. However, the specifics of Bararoá's relationship with local Indigenous groups—the social, cultural, and missionary dynamics—remain underexplored. I have not yet directly targeted the mission's interaction with these Indigenous nations. To fill this gap, I will now search for information on 'Bararoá mission indigenous relations.' This approach should yield details on how the mission functioned socially and culturally, and its impact on or integration with local Indigenous peoples. If this search is unproductive, I will consider external sources or more specific entity queries. I will avoid repeating previous queries and focus on this new angle.",
