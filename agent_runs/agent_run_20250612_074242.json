If this search yields only information already present in supporting_evidence, I will need to pivot my approach. My next steps would likely involve exploring the aftermath of Bararoá's destruction (its renaming to Thomar and subsequent loss of status), or investigating the fate of its inhabitants and their integration into other settlements. I am also prepared to try alternative entry points, such as searching for references to Nossa Senhora do Rosário (the parish's patron) or using spelling variants, should direct searches for Bararoá become unproductive. I will carefully review the results of this search to determine if any new facts or perspectives emerge.",
