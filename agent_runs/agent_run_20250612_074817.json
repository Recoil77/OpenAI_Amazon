The settlement of Bararoá, once with 780 households, had declined to 13 households, though the number of inhabitants did not decrease proportionally due to widespread dispersion. The geography of Pará, with its many rivers, lakes, and fertile banks, encouraged people to live scattered for easier access to hunting, fishing, and wild fruits. Natives maintained houses in settlements mainly for religious duties and festivals but lived primarily outside, especially as settlements declined due to lack of ministers and weakened authority. Many settlements were abandoned and fell into ruin, making population counts based on settlements unreliable.",

Governor D. Francisco de Souza Coutinho of Pará, seeking to hinder the Captaincy of Rio Negro under Manoel da Gama Lobo da Almada, secured the Directory’s dissolution by royal letter, leading to Indigenous dispersal and the decline or disappearance of several settlements. There was debate about whether merging the Directory’s regulations with those of the Missions—combining the roles of Missionary and Director—would have yielded better results.
