To increase specificity, I want to gather any explicit historical or geographical descriptors of Thomar on the Rio Negro—such as its distance from other towns (e.g., Mariuá, Santa Izabel) or any subsequent references to Thomar in the archival record. This should also help clarify whether Thomar persisted as a distinct entity into later periods, or if its memory/location/output faded from later accounts, which often happens with such colonial-era creations. My last steps focused on Bararoá's relocation and transformation, but now I need a direct vector search on 'Thomar Rio Negro location description' to target those post-1758 clues and connect them to any potential modern correlate or enduring reference, key to properly fixing Bararoá's final position.",
