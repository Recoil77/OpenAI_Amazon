In the middle of 1839, the Carmelite Friar José dos Innocentes was sent as a missionary up the Rio Branco to the territory of Pirarára, whose disposition convinced the dissenting missionary of the convenience of his withdrawal. After Bararoá, the administration of the district was assumed, also as Military Commander, by Captain of the National Guard José Antonio d'Oliveira Horta, to whom was later joined Navy Lieutenant Joaquim Sabino da Silva by order of the Command of the Expedition to the Amazon. The unwise nature of such a partnership soon produced its natural consequences; and in March 1840, two couriers descended the Amazon carrying mutual complaints to the Commander of the Expedition, then Lieutenant Colonel Manoel Muniz Tavares, who replied by communicating the appointment of Navy Lieutenant Lourenço da Silva Araujo e Amazonas to the Military Command of the District. Pardoned by Decree of November 4, 1849, the rebels of that dreadful five-year period presented their submission in the town of Lusea on March 28, 1840. Eight hundred men there surrendered their arms, and soon after, pacification was achieved everywhere, both by the presentation of the pardoned and by their withdrawal to other districts. The idea of gathering in the settlements individuals from different parties, full of resentment from mutual offenses, was indeed a cause for serious apprehension, as such feelings are naturally hard to forget. However, this fear was overcome both by the conviction shared by all of the need to put an end to so many misfortunes, and by the sincere efforts of the Expedition Authorities, in whose orders the following passage can be read: \"I order that wherever such individuals (pardoned) arrive, they shall be treated humanely, as loyal subjects of His Majesty the Emperor Dom Pedro II, and citizens in full enjoyment of all the rights guaranteed by the Political Constitution of the Empire. I forbid anyone to remind them spitefully of their previous conduct.\" That year (1840), the district owed to the benevolent consideration of the Command of the Expedition to the Amazon the tolerance of allowing individuals involved in past military uprisings to be judged in civil courts, for which reason they were returned to their homes; and the tacit exemption from corporal punishment for the National Guards, then called Police, as well as from conscription, which weighed upon other districts—a revolting measure, always observed alongside restorations, and which constitutes their greatest misfortune, apart from the burnings in Bahia. The news of a project in the Chamber of Deputies for the elevation of the district to the status of Province could not be more",
