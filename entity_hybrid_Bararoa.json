Bararoá, once with 780 households, had declined to 13 households according to Baena, yet still reportedly had 439 inhabitants, illustrating a disproportion between households and population due to dispersion. The fertile riverbanks and abundance of natural resources such as hunting, fishing, and wild fruits encouraged people to settle outside formal settlements. Natives maintained houses in settlements mainly for religious duties and festivals but lived primarily in dispersed locations, especially as settlements declined from lack of ministers and weakened authority. Many settlements were abandoned and fell into ruin, with populations moving to remote sources of rivers and lakes, making accurate population counts by settlement unreliable.",

Francisco de Souza Coutinho, Governor of Pará, to hinder the progress of the Captaincy of Rio Negro under Manoel da Gama Lobo da Almada. The Jesuits were implicated in Indigenous withdrawals from Marina and São Paulo, the uprising and desertion of Mariuá troops, and the rebellions at Lama-Longa, Caboquena, and Bararoá, aiming to revert the Amazon to wilderness. The dissolution of the Directory led to the dispersal and disappearance of some Indigenous settlements. In 1823, José Bonifacio argued for merging the Directory and Mission systems, suggesting that uniting the roles of Missionary and Director could have yielded better outcomes for Indigenous civilization efforts in the Empire of Brazil.
