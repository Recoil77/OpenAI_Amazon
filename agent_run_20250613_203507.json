The geography of Pará, with its fertile riverbanks and abundant natural resources, encouraged people to live scattered for easier access to hunting, fishing, and gathering. Natives maintained houses in settlements mainly for religious duties and festivals but resided primarily outside them. The decline of settlements was exacerbated by a lack of religious ministers and weakened authority, leading inhabitants to distance themselves further from settlements. Many settlement houses fell into ruin due to abandonment and light construction, causing some settlements to disappear entirely. Population counts based on settlements became unreliable, as most people lived dispersed in remote areas, avoiding official registration and census efforts.",

Its dissolution, orchestrated by Governor D. Francisco de Souza Coutinho of Pará to hinder the progress of the Captaincy of Rio Negro, led to the dispersal and decline of Indigenous settlements. The Jesuits were implicated in fomenting unrest, including Indigenous withdrawals from Marina and São Paulo, troop uprisings in Mariuá, and rebellions in Lama-Longa, Caboquena, and Bararoá, aiming to return the region to a state of wilderness. Some contemporaries believed that merging the Directory’s regulations with those of the Missions—combining the roles of Missionary and Director—would have yielded better results in integrating Indigenous communities. José Bonifacio, in 1823, supported this view, noting differences between Indigenous groups in regions like São Paulo and Minas versus those in the Amazon, with the former being more nomadic and the latter more settled due to abundant waterways. The dissolution of the Directory resulted in the reduction or disappearance of several Indigenous settlements. The text suggests that a more effective policy could have been achieved by synthesizing the Directory’s and Mission’s approaches, tailored to regional Indigenous lifestyles.",

Most houses are single-story with red-tiled roofs, brick floors, and white- or yellow-washed walls, with green doors and shutters. The original fort is now reduced to a fragment of wall and a mound of earth; there are two churches, both considered poor compared to that of Santarem. The population numbers five to six thousand, predominantly Indians and people of mixed descent, with little to no pure European lineage remaining due to extensive intermarriage. The main exports are Brazil nuts, sarsaparilla, and fish, while imports include inferior European cotton goods, coarse cutlery, beads, mirrors, and trinkets for trade with local tribes. The city serves as a trade headquarters for the region, with a difficult supply line from Para, about a thousand miles away, making many goods expensive and scarce. Social life is centered on trade, with little intellectual activity, and Sunday mass is a key occasion for elaborate dress and social visits.",

The Manãos, a prominent and warlike tribe in the area, frequently waged war on neighboring groups and enslaved captured prisoners. The Portuguese justified their slave-trading activities by claiming to ransom (resgatar) captives, a term that persisted in local trade for the illegal purchase of Indian children.

Established in the 18th century, it was one of several villages founded by merchants and Carmelite missionaries during that period. The village was part of a network of settlements that included Santo Elias do Jaú, Aracari, Cumaru, Mariuá, São Caetano, Cabuquena, and Dari. ([academia.edu](https://www.academia.edu/49213801/Indigenous_Activism_Territorialization_and_Ethnicity_in_the_Middle_Rio_Negro?utm_source=openai))\n\nIn 1758, the Portuguese colonial administration elevated Bararuá to the status of a vila (town) and renamed it Thomar. However, in 1833, the settlement reverted to its original name, Bararuá. ([catadordepapeis.blogspot.com](https://catadordepapeis.blogspot.com/2013/03/ambrosio-aires-o-bararoa.html?utm_source=openai))\n\nDuring the Cabanagem revolt (1835–1840), a significant regional uprising in the Amazon, Bararuá played a notable role. Ambrósio Aires, a deportee to the Rio Negro region, settled in Bararuá and became a prominent figure in the defense against the Cabanagem rebels. He was known for his commitment to protecting the local population and was willing to use his personal resources to fund defense efforts. His dedication earned him the nickname \"Bararoá,\" derived from the village's name. ([catadordepapeis.blogspot.com](https://catadordepapeis.blogspot.com/2013/03/ambrosio-aires-o-bararoa.html?utm_source=openai))\n\nBy the mid-19th century, Bararuá, like many other settlements along the Rio Negro, experienced decline. Travel accounts from that era describe it as a small, half-ruined, and almost uninhabited village. ([people.wku.edu](https://people.wku.edu/charles.smith/wallace/S011.htm?utm_source=openai))\n\nToday, Bararuá stands as a testament to the complex history of colonization, indigenous interactions, and regional conflicts in the Amazon basin.

([academia.edu](https://www.academia.edu/49213801/Indigenous_Activism_Territorialization_and_Ethnicity_in_the_Middle_Rio_Negro?utm_source=openai))\n\nThe establishment of settlements like Bararuá was accompanied by prolonged conflicts with indigenous groups who resisted colonial encroachment. Notably, the Manao, Tarumã, and Baré peoples, who inhabited the lower Rio Negro, engaged in sustained resistance against Portuguese forces. ([academia.edu](https://www.academia.edu/49213801/Indigenous_Activism_Territorialization_and_Ethnicity_in_the_Middle_Rio_Negro?utm_source=openai))\n\nThe colonial presence in the Rio Negro region led to significant disruptions for indigenous communities. The construction of forts and villages facilitated the capture and forced labor of indigenous peoples, contributing to population declines due to violence, displacement, and exposure to European diseases. The establishment of settlements like Bararuá played a role in these processes, as they served as centers for colonial administration and missionary activities aimed at assimilating indigenous populations.\n\nIn summary, Bararuá was one of several settlements established during the 18th century as part of Portuguese colonial expansion along the Rio Negro. Its history is intertwined with the broader context of colonial efforts to control the region and the resulting impacts on indigenous communities, including conflict, forced labor, and cultural disruption.
